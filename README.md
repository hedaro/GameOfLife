#Conway's Game of Life

## Usage
You need to install [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org) dev libraries.
You also need OpenGL which is probably already installed in your system.
The project includes a makefile, just run `make` in the terminal while on the project's root directory.

## TODOS
* Separate SDL and OGL code from the main file
* Separte Game of Life logic from the header file
* Add functions to generate patterns to the library
* Organize code functions better
